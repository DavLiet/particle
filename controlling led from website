/**This is a simple html form where the parameter for "action" is the website we are sending informaiton to.
The parameter for "method" is "POST" because we are sending information to the particle api (aka the particle board)
  Specifically, you need three things for the url parameter for "action". They are:
   1) The access tokem
   2) The unique id of the particle board
   3) The name of the function. This should be the first parameter of Particle.function(first,second).
   
   Here is a the URL used for "action": "https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/[DEVICE ID]/[FUNCTION NAME]?access_token=[ACCESS-TOKEN]" **/

   // This is saying that when we ask the cloud for the function "led", it will employ the function ledToggle() from this app.

   // For good measure, let's also make sure both LEDs are off when we start:
   digitalWrite(led1, LOW);
   digitalWrite(led2, LOW);

Since we're waiting for input through the cloud this time,
we don't actually need to put anything in the loop */

    Since we can pass a string, it means that we can give the program commands on how the function should be used.
    In this case, telling the function "on" will turn the LED on and telling it "off" will turn the LED off.
    Then, the function returns a value to us to let us know what happened.
    In this case, it will return 1 for the LEDs turning on, 0 for the LEDs turning off,
    and -1 if we received a totally bogus command that didn't do anything to the LEDs.
